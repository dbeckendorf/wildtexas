<p><img src="stephenfaustin.jpeg" class="left">Texas has about a dozen grape species. Grape vine are so common The Stephen F. Austin noted that "nature seems to have intended Texas for a vineyard". The early pioneers to Texas claimed that the vines were so dense that "it seemed...one could climb and walk at ease from tree to tree". Reports of grapevine trunks as thick as a man's body were not uncommon.</p>
<p><img src="grapetendrils.jpg" class="right">One of the reasons grape vines are so successful is their ability to climb other structures to gain access to sunlight. They use tendrils to cling to these structures. Tendrils of different species of plants orginate from different parts, but grape vines use modified flower stalks to form tendrils. In most species, tendrils form opposite of two sets of leaves, then skip a set, then form across from two more consecutive sets, and the pattern continues. Later on, when the flowers form, the flowers follow the same pattern of forming across from the first two sets of leaves, then skipping a set. Once the tendril touches an object, such as a branch of a tree, the opposite side of the tendril grows, forcing the tendril to curve around the object. Grape vines use this method to quickly climb trees to get to the precious sunlight. The can actually be so successful at this that they block the sunlight from their "host" tree.</p>
<p><img src="godgrapes.jpg" class="left">Grapes are extremely useful to humans. We have been eating them for thousands of years.They have numerous health benefits. One thing to note here when we're talking about our native wild grapes: they're grapes, just like the ones you buy in the grocery store. Any health benefits of the grapes you buy in the store will also be held by the wild ones you find in your backyard. The difference here is that you should NOT eat the skin of wild grapes; they are so acidic that it will cause a throat pain. Of the STORE-BOUGHT ones, however, we must add that RED grapes have the health benefits; green grapes apparently have little-to-no benefits. Red grapes have been linked to fighting both colon and breast cancer. However, their most useful chemical is apparently one called resveratrol.For example, grapes have been shown to lower blood sugar, and resveratrol has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity. Therefore, logically, resveratrol may be the chemical in grapes that is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels (more studies need to be conducted, though). Another health benefit is protection from ultraviolet light. Resveratrol has been shown in test tube studies to protect the retina from ultravoilet light damage, Additionally, two other compounds in grapes (lutein and zeaxanthin) have been found to do the same thing. Logic would point to grapes being a GREAT food to eat if you work outdoors! My favorite health benefit of grapes, though (in terms of pure entertainment) has to be its ability to  put us in a better mood. A study on young adults showed that their moods improved 20 minutes after drinking grape juice, compared to those that didn't drink grape juice. That, in itself, isn't humorous, but what IS humorous is that in another study, resveratrol by itself was shown to improve mood in rats (How did the researchers measure how good of a mood the rats were in? &#128514;&#128514;)! My favorite health benefit as far as usefulness goes, though, is the grape's ability to fight virus and bacterial infections!<img src="CoronaVirus.jpg" class="right"> First of all, grapes are a moderately good source of vitamin C, which is very well-known for its contribution to the human immune system. Grape skin extract has been shown to fight the herpes virus and chicken pox (has anybody thought to try it out against Coronavirus?)! Resveratrol has been shown to stop the growth of <i>E. coli</i>, so resveratrol again may be responsible for this!</p>
<p><img src="Daktul.jpg" class="left">This is all fascinating stuff, in my mind. However, the MOST fascinating is our native species' history of rescuing the French wine industry. You see, when the explorers first arrived here in the New World, they discovered that roughly 75&#37; of the world's grape species were here. They then imported our species to Europe to try out wine made with them (What ELSE would you expect a bunch of Europeans to do with newly discovered species of grape? &#128514;). Along with the grape vines, however, came the insects; particularly a species of louse (pictured left) that wreaked havoc on the native species of Europe by girdling the rootstock and killing the vine, but only produced small galls on the undersides of the leaves (also pictured left)of exotic species from the New World. The European wine industry was potentially ruined until Texas came along to rescue it! You see, our soil is much like the French soil, so a man named Thomas Munson grafted rootstock of our grape species to the vines of the European species, et voil&#224;!! The European wine industry was saved, and millions of drunks around the world have Texas to thank for it!!!&#128516;</p></div>
